    Heres How I exploited GameSense.pub  with subdomain takeover. I was showing my discord how to use the russian openid key the documented for resellers in test.sql in. my dump of the Gamesense.pup had an old key that was a admin account, also using domain www.gamesense.pub. full partner and admin account, cheaper to get access to admin via onboarding for 100$ while while doing it,  This shit cheat , confused dev ( self proclaimed coding legend ) really exposes himself. with every DNS record.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   
  As soon as I did sent this request in my chrome browser ( that healso points to with chrome connect) I choose from the 
  sites listed, i choose www.gamesense.pub; and sure enough this idiot has his admin account set up but using steam sdk's mongo content server meant for normal web api users to use as a store. So when steam auths me www.gamesense.pub, 
  I quickly wrote the wwww as CNAME  records on a few of my host providjust because I was really curious you could say., he loses the  www.  because its lost its service. to steam, leaving a dandgling record with no nameservers or authoritive records to stop it. I understand his @root should be gamesense.pub,  that MX & txt records are for mail.. gamesenser.pub is on his computer as local  MX record, that will never recdeive mail from nameservers set up as a CNAME record.  cloudflare nameservers; pointing at steam trying real hard to point back at cloud" Rightside Group Ltd "  because he doxed himself when he filed copy right infringment  against the gamesense.is for a cheat he didnt make and content he didnt create. reseller of it. the cheat services he at sold him the cheat, because they " cracked dns records point int to steam, while his registar donuts and all other CORS services fail exposing every origin endpoint. This dude will hang himself. im sure he will to know how I dump his stuff with his deveoper tools, on servers he ight into hisclone back ups of his  VPS still well steam services  services, while cdn records on his registar locally serving the content to steam instead of using steam cloud. OK awesome; gamesense.pub is down.   this link NeverLoses: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey/activate?F4EB2D6CED2B4BDDAD9DF913287E6768&steamid=YOURSTEAMID7777777#shere
